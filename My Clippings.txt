However, if you practice elaboration, there’s no known limit to how much you can learn. Elaboration is the pro cess of giving new material meaning by expressing it in your own words and connecting it with what you already know. The more you can explain about the way your new learning relates to your prior knowledge, the stronger your grasp of the new learning will be, and the more connections you create that will help you remember it later.

The German scientist Sebastian Leitner developed his own system for spaced practice of fl ashcards, known as the Leitner box. Think of it as a series of four fi le- card boxes. In the fi rst are the study materials (be they musical scores, hockey moves, or Spanish vocabulary fl ashcards) that must be practiced frequently because you often make mistakes in them. In the second box are the cards you’re pretty good at, and that

box gets practiced less often than the fi rst, perhaps by a half. The cards in the third box are practiced less often than those in the second, and so on. If you miss a question, make mistakes in the music, fl ub the one-touch pass, you move it up a box so you will practice it more often. The underlying idea is simply that the better your mastery, the less frequent the practice, but if it’s important to retain, it will never disappear completely from your set of practice boxes.

Through the faculty of will-power, one may discourage the presence of any emotion, and encourage the presence of any other. Control of the mind, through the power of will, is not difficult. Control comes from persistence, and habit. The secret of control lies in understanding the process of transmutation. When any negative emotion presents itself in one's mind, it can be transmuted into a positive, or constructive emotion, by the simple procedure of changing one's thoughts.

Three deep breaths. Smile. Pet the dog. Repeat. Eventually, you’ll begin to associate this breathe-and-smile routine with being in a good mood. It becomes a cue that means feeling happy. Once established, you can break it out anytime you need to change your emotional state. Stressed at work? Take three deep breaths and smile. Sad about life? Three deep breaths and smile. Once a habit has been built, the cue can prompt a craving, even if it has little to do with the original situation.

When you feel murderous due to pure frustration or irritation, remember that you can express anger before it seems overwhelming—or figure out why you can’t. If your anger is defensive—due to feeling deeply attacked or shamed by the other person, so that you’d like to destroy this person before he or she can destroy your core you—then it could be that your core self is weak and needs strengthening through inner work and perhaps psychotherapy. Or else the other person is all too good at finding the part of you most easily wounded—in which case he or she is acting (not just feeling an impulse) to hurt you; this does not work and should not be tolerated in an intimate relationship.
